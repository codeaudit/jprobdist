JProbDist is a Java library that contains a class hierarchy of probability distributions, and at some later point, simple statistical procedures.

It can be used as a library in applications that require easy access to standard probability distributions (including arbitrary finite distributions).

Its main purpose, though, is to be a teaching device for object-oriented programming.
